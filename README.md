i haven't implemented working read receipts yet, but the way the email as drafted implies a shit ton of twitch guilt if they read it and don't respond or don't report you to law enforcement; even if they block you, they still imply guilt; just make a new account

python openai_config.py

python gmail_twitch.py

python gmail_all.py

python outlook_twitch.py

python outlook_all.py

To get App Specific Passwords for your Gmail account, you need to set up 2FA first. It's under the "security" tab in your Google account.

Your email and passwords are stored locally in config.pickle and openai.pickle (unencrypted) so don't upload it without encrypting it first. There are ways to use encryption such as symmetric key to bake encryption into this app, but this is meant to be open source and as easy to understand as possible.

Also after you make one fully automatic process, including phone verification if necessary (which I'm not sure is even needed for Twitch), they just can't block anything at all, especially if you regenerate everything through AI. I don't think I can legally open source code that automates another service besides Twitch, but it is relatively easy to do.

There are 3 main motivations for automated accusatory emails:

1. So they have a harder time denying they know they are committing many specific violations on purpose.

2. So they may respond with more incriminating evidence.

3. So they may go to law enforcement to complain about "harassment" or something, even though as either a victim or witness reporting specific violations to the perpetrator, you don't meet the definition of having "harassed" under any applicable law. However law enforcement may ask them if these allegations are true, to which they may self-incriminate from, essentially turning themselves in.

Are you sure that your business model is not 18 U.S. Code § 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television in a nutshell? Are you sure you aren't guilty of something more sinister in more serious crimes or human rights abuses? 
Hi Twitch Employee or Contractor or Someone Affiliated with Twitch Criminals,

You claim that Twitch requires all users to follow the law, yet Twitch policies often explicitly contradict the law. For example you did not start banning the promotion of any illegal online gambling websites until Oct 18 2022, yet illegal online gambling was made wire fraud in the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 and later regulated in 2011 under 18 U.S. Code § 1955 - Prohibition of illegal gambling businesses. Streamers who promote online gambling are essentially ‘conducting’ the business. Moreover promotion of the business is prohibited under 18 U.S. Code § 1084 - Transmission of wagering information; penalties' and numerous other laws. You could see dozens if not hundreds of these streams at any point during any day.

As of today there are only 4 illegal gambling websites banned out of perhaps thousands, and your moderation team does not respond to any legal violations besides the 4. They also don't respond to a vast majority of logical and factual arguments made from either applicable laws or Twitch's own legal documents (ToS and Community Guidelines).

Take xqc for example, according to multiple news websites he gambled $685M from 2021 - 2022 while streaming on Twitch on a single illegal crypto gambling site while living in Texas. He must have received at least tens of millions of dollars in illegal kickbacks if he were to sustain those losses somehow. In fact there are numerous YouTube videos and news articles documenting him offering his promo code. xqc must have millions of victims by now. Why have you not reported xqc to the police?

Does pokimane actively solicit donations online with whatever means possible from people who like her romantically? if she doesn't feel the same way, does she communicate it, stop soliciting, or does she keep going? Why did she explicitly promised her victims her ‘undying love and appreciation’ in exchange for a prime sub? It's just retarded pedophillia or something.... Go ahead keep banning all of your victims so you only hear what you want to hear. What happens when your remaining victims find out how relationships are actually supposed to work? https://www.google.com/search?q=why+do+people+hate+pokimane

Pokimane supports calling the people who have a romantic attraction to her the derogatory term of "simps" whom she abuses donations from. She also said “Isn’t it weird young boys are being told ‘simping’ is so terrible?" in support of her crimes against humanity. She then claimed that people pointing out how relationships are actually supposed to work are simply "sexist" or "misogynist." Holy fucking god I won't directly shoot her but I may develop hypersonic missiles to take her out if the order is given.

Do depressed "little boys" (according to pokimane) enjoy donating to someone they have a crush on? I don't think females have the same tendency because of inherent traits.

More generally streamers have a habit of misrepresenting themselves which qualify as 18 U.S. Code § 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television violations' by definition, yet misrepresentation in order to solicit donations doesn't seem explicitly banned at all. Moreover your streamers often immediately ban anyone who complain about being defrauded, which may constitute witness intimidation in many jurisdictions.

There are numerous other obvious violations and inconsistencies across your platform and your only goal seems to be to cover up in order to further your conspiracy. It is blatantly obvious that your perpetrators are completely pathological and have zero respect for any of their victims. Most of your viewers seem depressed, and those victims just latch onto whatever social need they may have in search of fraudulent dopamine. This is not healthy for your victims and causes massive mental health damage and possibly other damage as a result of mental health.

People need to think about what they're doing to other people; if people are intentionally (or can be considered reasonably intentionally) doing damage to others, then they are criminals by definition; after that, you just have to look up specific laws to report crime. This will always be true in any law-based rational society. Twitch only causes harm through a criminal dopamine grab; nothing more. I'm not sure if the fraudulent dopamine argument has been settled in US courts before. I intend to test my theory on Amazon via a civil lawsuit.

If you want some fraudulent dopamine, why not buy some from the dark net? https://www.cvs.com

America was founded on the principle of free thought that all men and eventually women and minorities are created equal. Therefore Twitch is treason by definition. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381

Are you sure your main motivation to defraud and conceal is not your intention to subject your users to your will in order to subdue your users' willpower to extract whatever revenue you can abuse from them? If you think few rational people watch Twitch, it's probably because few do; most users are naive and/or disabled. (and/or specifically gaming disorder, or even gambling disorder)

Are you sure that even in the most benign use cases, trying to convince as many vulnerable people to watch you play games and encourage them to offer support for your ‘streaming’ helps people on average? Are you sure that you’re not so fake that you’re willing to cause massive intentional damage to society as long as your ‘business’ model seems to work. Are you sure you’re not trying to brainwash an entire population into adopting an unsustainable lifestyle because paying money to watch other people play video games just doesn’t make any sense. How do normal people get this money? Do their lives improve or worsen upon spending this money? Who are your customers? Have you ever thought about that?

Twitch saps the fighting force of any nation it operates in and put strain on the social welfare and health systems. Twitch is totally unsustainable and eventually will destroy much of society unless it’s checked.

As a citizen of some country, you’re generally required to pledge allegiance to it, so are you sure that you’re not intentionally trying to harm society by intentionally poisoning the minds of so many vulnerable people?

If I were to shoplift a bag of chips and made it known to the store owner, I would almost certainly be arrested. Why is Twitch allowed to get away with fundamental human rights abuses in addition to gross amounts of crime? How is this not a clear national security threat to every country Twitch operates in? Some parts of the Internet is a national security threat in general.

If governments and law enforcement truly wanted to offer their citizens/residents the best chance at a fulfilling, meaningful, and honest life, they should shut down clear Internet crime that influences and abuses many millions and sometimes even billions of people.

If you happen to have information of corporate communication documenting corporate thought process that reveals this fraud, or any other criminal activity committed by Twitch, please send it to me or to law enforcement directly.

If you think I’m wrong, please tell me why. If you think I’m harassing you, please report me to law enforcement like I’m going to report you.

Lastly are you sure you’re not trying to develop and promote illiteracy nukes and deploy them against society? Your streamers seem barely literate at best and your chat is totally incoherent. Would your victims even know how to get the most out of other people’s software such as GPT4 if they were illiterate? Does this not create massively more inequality across society in addition to all the other problems it causes? Should your email centrifuges be temporarily disabled?

All of your streamers and many of your users seem preoccupied complying with your highly illegal “Twitch ToS” instead of learning how to abide by actual law. What kind of game are you trying to play with their minds? and also the minds of their viewers, and the people whom your viewers influence, etc.

Twitch only causes harm through a criminal dopamine grab; nothing more.

Sincerely,
Sadly one of Twitch's many millions of victims or one witness to many Twitch crimes

Auto-AI Powered Email to Twitch: https://github.com/bshang165-2/accusatory-emails-twitch

That's right; Twitch is committing innumerable amounts of crime including Treason and Rebellion or Insurrection as hate crimes against society as a whole (but also specifically protected groups, as defined under hate crime law, that are part of society), to the presumed benefit (at least that's what they think) of their pathological streamers and employees.

If you want to sue a criminal organization such as Twitch, make sure to take out their General Counsel and other legal staff first, because they are not allowed to intentionally misrepresent a criminal organization as a legitimate business if sued in civil court.

I think I referred to Twitch as "osama bin dumbass" before because they technically don't explicitly promote violence but in reality probably do. In 2020, they called the police saying I was "threatening" Jeff Bezos' kids when I emailed him that his kids would suffer in a world with Twitch or something? Good fucking god. Amazon is just corporate fucking abuse on normal people.

Additionally in 2020, Twitch actually told the police that I was trying to "impersonate" their staff when I registered twitch.engineering. Do they think they're so good that anyone would want to impersonate them? Obviously I registered it under fair use, and I just registered another one. I can't tell if they were intentionally trying to lie to the police.

Twitch forces their victims to believe that Twitch is a legitimate business rather than a fraudulent industry that commits every type of human rights abuse possible, by attempting to silence their victims through corporate ToS and even by making false reports to law enforcement.

What have you learned here compared to what you learned watching a Twitch stream? Think about this question. Twitch is potentially growing at a ~n^n rate by trying to convince an entire population to adopt a non-productive (at best) or criminal (often) lifestyle. They are just not a sustainable use of human potential. 

Someone should tell the Congress, the President, and the FBI, (and whomever really) that network complexity has gotten too complex. There is simply zero regulation or enforcement on parts of the Internet and that has not only made criminal violations absurdly prevalent across the Internet, but has also significantly harmed the lives of many particularly young and vulnerable people. Congress should figure out a way to reduce network complexity so people can get back to how "normal" people used to live before the Internet became so prevalent, when abuse and mental health wasn't so widespread.

When you make a statement to law enforcement, you are subjected to questions about that statement. therefore you shouldn't make any until you're ready

I'm just trying to start an investigation without making any statements via various methods, and also trying to bait Twitch to make statements. I'm also obviously trying to promote public interest on Twitch as an example but how to learn a general lesson from it. I'm also promoting the legal-only (read the laws in your jurisdiction) of crowd-run SIGINT and Cyberwarfare operations on criminal networks.

You'd have to understand 4th and 5th Amendment rights and how law enforcement works to understand what I just said. Also they can't tell you anything by law if you don't have security clearance, etc. etc.

There are many privacy rights in the United States and elsewhere. However those tend to start going away when you start engaging in illegal activity. Also if you're clean I'm not sure what people would do with your private data anyways even if they unlawfully looked at it.

However nobody has privacy rights for any data they voluntarily put in the "public" sphere.
